# LoadoutFramework
The [LoadoutFramework](https://github.com/simon84/LoadoutFramework) simplifies the creation of unit loadouts in Arma 3.

This script based approach uses config class definitions as loadout definitions. Due to this technique, class inheritance is possible and simplifies the mission editors life.

## Usage
### Setup
1. Copy the `loadoutFramework` folder to your mission folder
2. Edit your `description.ext` and include following:
```
#include "loadoutFramework\base.hpp"

class CfgFunctions {
	#include "loadoutFramework\cfgFunctions.hpp"
};
```

### Create Loadouts
Every user created loadout is described in `loadoutFramework/cfgLoadouts.hpp`. In this file, only classes inherited from the `Collection`-class should be inserted.
#### The `Collection`-class
The `Collection`-class is the base class for all classes defined in the framework. This class describes the basic loadout-slots used in the framework.
```
class Collection {
	uniform[] = {}; // Uniform. e.g. {'U_B_CombatUniform_mcam'}
	vest[] = {}; // Vest
	headgear[] = {}; // Headgear like helmets
	goggle[] = {}; // Goggles
	backpack[] = {}; // Backpack
	primaryWeapon[] = {}; //primary Weapon
	primaryWeaponOptic[]={}; // Scope for primary Weapon 
	primaryWeaponMuzzle[]={}; // Muzzle Attachment for prim. Weapon
	primaryWeaponBarrel[] = {}; // Barrel Attachment for prim Weapon
	primaryWeaponResting[] = {}; // Weapon Resting Attachment like bi-pods
	primaryWeaponLoadedMagazine[] = {}; // the loaded magazine
	secondaryWeapon[] = {}; // secondary Weapon
	secondaryWeaponOptic[]={}; // same like primaryWeaponOptic see above
	secondaryWeaponMuzzle[]={};
	secondaryWeaponBarrel[] = {};
	secondaryWeaponResting[] = {};
	secondaryWeaponLoadedMagazine[] = {};
	handgun[] = {}; // handgun
	handgunOptic[]={}; // same like primaryWeaponOptic see above
	handgunMuzzle[]={};
	handgunBarrel[] = {};
	handgunLoadedMagazine[] = {};
	binocular[] = {};
	magazines[] = {}; // all magazines which can be stored in uniform, vest or backpack depending on space. E.g. {{"30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer",3},{"30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag",6}}; for 3x 30 Rnd 6.5x39mm caseless Tracer and 6x 30 Rnd 6.5x39mm caseless magazines
	items[] = {}; // all other items (magazines are also possible) which can be stored in uniform, vest or backpack depending on space. Same definition like magazines[].
	itemsUniform[] = {}; // all items (magazines are also possible) which have to be stored in uniform. Same definition like magazines[].
	itemsVest[]={}; // all items (magazines are also possible) which have to be stored in vest. Same definition like magazines[].
	itemsBackpack[] = {}; // all items (magazines are also possible) which have to be stored in backpack. Same definition like magazines[].
	linkedItems[]={};// all items which are linked to a special slot (NVG, Map, Watch etc.). E.g. {"ItemWatch","ItemCompass","ItemMap","NVGoggles"};
	script[]={};// A script which is executed after applying loadout.
};
```
Every property is defined as an array. This allows the user to define multiple e.g. uniforms. The system chooses then one uniform randomly.

#### Custom Loadout

By inheriting the `Collection`-class (`class MyLoadout : Collection`), you can define your custom loadout by filling the properties. As class inheritance is possible, you can define additional loadouts based on other loadouts. 

Additional, you are able to aggregate sub-collections. Maybe you want to have a medical backpack and some weapons with a predefined magazine loadout, you can create some sub-collections which can be added to your unit-loadout.
```
class Weapon_MX : Collection { // ideally added to cfgTemplates.hpp but not necessary
	primaryWeapon[] = {"arifle_MX_F"};
	primaryWeaponOptic[]={"optic_Aco"};
	primaryWeaponLoadedMagazine[]={"30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag"};
	primaryWeaponBarrel[] = {"acc_pointer_IR"};
	magazines[] = {{"30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag_Tracer",3},{"30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag",6}};
};

class AnotherClass : Collection { 
...
};

class Rifleman : Collection {
	uniform[] = {"U_B_CombatUniform_mcam"};
	vest[] = {"V_PlateCarrierL_CTRG"};
	headgear[] = {"H_HelmetB_camo"};
	goggle[] = {"G_Combat"};
	backpack[] = {"B_AssaultPack_mcamo"};
	handgun[] = {"hgun_P07_F"};
	magazines[] = {{"16Rnd_9x21_Mag",2}};
	itemsBackpack[] = {{"FirstAidKit",3}};
	linkedItems[]={"ItemWatch","ItemCompass","ItemMap","NVGoggles"};
	class PrimaryWeaponClass : Weapon_MX { // Some Collections added to Rifleman Collection
	  primaryWeaponOptic[]={}; // Change optic to iron sight for this collection
	};
	class AnotherSubCollaction : AnotherClass {};
};
```
As shown in this example, you can simply overwrite certain properties (primary weapon was changed to iron sight), if you wish to change the loadout for some loadouts.

Sub-collections which are not usable standalone, should be created in the `cfgTemplates.hpp`-file.


#### Applying the Loadout
The function `BG_fnc_applyLoadout` applies the loadout to a unit.

Syntax: `[<unit>,<loadoutName>] call BG_fnc_applyLoadout;`

Note: `<unit>` has to be local!
